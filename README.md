# HASH- HIV Aids Support House


PROJECT DESCRIPTION:
The goal is to ease difficulties in accessing HIV testing and telemedicine services by creating a comprehensive mobile app for the HASH HIV & AIDS Support House Organization. This app will simplify scheduling HIV tests and telemedicine consultations with medical experts. Users can select preferred dates and times, check availability, and receive confirmation messages. 

The app will feature educational materials on HIV management, treatment, and prevention, promoting proactive healthcare practices. Telemedicine services will enhance healthcare access, especially for those in rural or underserved areas, reducing the need for in-person visits.
